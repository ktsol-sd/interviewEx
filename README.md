# Assignment for an interview I did #

Overall a fun project I tried to add some stuff that would be a challenge instead of going "safe" like for example the checkbox was a bit of a challenge to set up and read the values but it worked. 

### Things to do/add if I had more time (in no particular order)
* Try and deploy this
* Some login/logout system with google auth
* An admin page
* Make the application prettier overall
* Image upload
* Optimize the code a bit
* Add a rich text editor
